title: Ruby's Notes

Welcome to my notes!

## Meet the author

I am Ruby Dragon, an amateur computer programmer attempting to become a graphics programmer someday. Currently focusing on shaders, specifically in Godot, Blender, and Unreal Engine. The most common programming languages I use are: C++, C, C#, Rust, GLSL, Python, and GDScript. I am making various projects to further my own learning, and I am documenting my process to hopefully help others who are looking for resources. My projects are private until I finish them, and then I will make them public for anybody to view, modify, use, or otherwise mess with.

Content will be coming soon, currently working on a project that will be shared here.

My projects are usually hosted on Github: https://github.com/Ruby-Dragon
